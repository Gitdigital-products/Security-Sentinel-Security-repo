## Purpose  
Software security is critical — but many projects lack automated scanning or policy enforcement. This tool helps you automatically scan for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or compliance violations before deployment, reducing risk and increasing code quality.

## Key Features  
- Static code analysis for common security issues (e.g. X, Y, Z)  
- Configurable rule sets / security policy enforcement  
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines (works well with LaunchFlow!)  
- Reports / alerts for discovered issues  

## Installation / Setup  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gitdigital-products/Security-Sentinel-Security-repo.git  
cd Security-Sentinel-Security-repo  
/* e.g. */  
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or npm install / etc.

(Adjust depending on language / tech stack.)

Usage / Scanning Examples

# Basic scan  
security-sentinel scan ./path/to/project  

# With custom config  
security-sentinel scan ./path/to/project --config sentinel-config.yml

(Provide full sample commands or config files as applicable.)
